<h1 align="left"> Data to Dashboard </h1>
Resources to help the everyday analyst get data, clean &amp; prep the data, store it, &amp; visualize it. 

<h1> Why does this resource exist? </h1>
I built this resource because not everyone is a "data" person in that they aren't a data engineer, didn't study data, or do a lot of the back-end work to make the data usable.  So many of us just need to get the number or the chart to make a decision, take an action, build a report; to just do our jobs. 

As the workforce changes, we are now expected to not just get the number or create the chart, we're expected to prepare the data (clean & transform it!) and then do our regular work. But if you're not a data person, how do you do that other stuff? ChatGPT is helpful though as of this writing, it doesn't get it right on the first time. 

**My goal is to provide these resources in a way that a lot of people can understand so that they can do their work efficiently and effectively.** 

Before we dive into resources, let's get an understanding of a basic data and analytics pipeline (the process of getting data to when it gets to the reporting or dashboard stage).

To understand how to gain skills across the pipeline, we need to have a shared understanding of what makes up the data pipeline.  For the purposes of these materials, the data pipeline looks like the following:
